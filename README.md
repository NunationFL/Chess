# Chess
Doing what has been done by thousands of people because I'm bored.
Plan is to make a chess game in python with all logic and special rules
Also make a simple UI with pygame maybe (IDK need to do some research first)
May delve into making my own AI with different levels of stupidity (or big brain :D)
